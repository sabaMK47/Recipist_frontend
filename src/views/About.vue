            Welcome to Recipist – your go-to destination for discovering delicious recipe ideas,
            fast and fuss-free!

            This website is part of a university project developed using Vue.js (frontend) and Laravel (backend),
            blending modern web technologies to serve one simple purpose: help you find inspiration for your next meal.

            But this project isn't just about the code. It’s also deeply personal.

            As a developer with a big passion for food and cooking, I’ve spent countless evenings hearing my mom ask the
            classic question:

            “What should I make for dinner?”

            And honestly… I didn’t always have a good answer.
            So, I built Recipist – a smart, searchable recipe app to help answer that question for her, for myself, and
            for anyone else who just needs a little cooking inspiration.

            Whether you’re a seasoned home cook or just hunting for something new to try, Recipist is here to make it
            easier to explore, filter, and find the perfect recipe based on what you love — or what’s in your fridge.

            Thanks for stopping by, and happy cooking! 👩‍🍳👨‍🍳
